Once you have retrieved the project, you can check that everything works with:

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then  it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should see a home page.

----
mvn clean package
mvn test exec:java
----

The project contains:

* a `pom.xml` file
* a _main_ verticle file (src/main/java/io/vertx/starter/MainVerticle.java)
